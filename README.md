Study Planner

This project is a full-stack web application built to help manage study tasks in a simple and structured way. It allows users to create tasks, mark them as completed, add optional deadlines and see how much time is left for each task.

The application is built using Next.js and TypeScript and is deployed in production on Vercel. A PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase is used for data persistence.
